        <h3>About this platform</h3>
        <p>
            This platform presents air quality measurements from Kumasi, Ghana, 
            with a focus on making nitrogen dioxide (NO₂) data accessible and understandable 
            for both residents and researchers. It brings together local ground-based measurements 
            and satellite observations to show how air pollution varies across the city and over time.
            The platform is designed to support awareness, research, and informed 
            decision-making around air quality in rapidly growing urban environments.
        </p>
        <h3>Measuring air pollution at street level</h3>
        <p>
            Air pollution in African cities is often poorly documented, 
            despite its major health impacts. To address this gap, 
            a measurement network was set up across Kumasi using low-cost diffusion tubes 
            that measure monthly average NO₂ concentrations. In 2025, 
            measurements were carried out at 20 locations across the city, 
            including traffic corridors, markets, residential areas, hospitals, 
            and urban background sites. This approach captures spatial differences 
            in exposure that are not visible in city-wide averages. 
            The measurements show that air pollution levels can vary strongly 
            within short distances, especially near busy roads and intersections.
        </p>
        <h3>Local measurements, global context</h3>
        <p>
           Ground-based measurements are combined with satellite observations of NO₂, 
           providing a broader view of air pollution at city scale. 
           Satellite data helps place local measurements in a wider spatial and temporal context, 
           while ground measurements are essential for validating and interpreting 
           what satellites observe over African cities. Together, 
           these data sources provide a more complete and reliable picture of air quality in Kumasi. 
        </p>
        <h3>Collaboration and local capacity</h3>
        <p>
            The platform is developed through a collaboration between 
            Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST) 
            and the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI). 
            KNUST plays a leading role in organising measurements, 
            operating the local laboratory, and analysing the data within Ghana. 
            KNMI supports the project with expertise in atmospheric science, satellite data, 
            and interpretation of the results. 
            This collaboration strengthens local capacity while ensuring scientific robustness.
