        <h3>Nitrogen Dioxide</h3>

        <h3>What is NO₂?</h3>
        <p>
            Nitrogen dioxide (NO₂) is a harmful air pollutant mainly produced by road traffic, 
            generators, and industrial activities.
        </p>
        <h3>What do the colours mean?</h3>
        <p>
            The colours on the map indicate air quality levels. 
            Green means air quality is generally safe. 
            Red means air quality may be unhealthy, especially for children and elderly people.
        </p>

        <p>
            Higher values indicate poorer air quality.
            The values shown represent average NO₂ concentrations over a longer period. 
            They reflect long-term exposure rather than short-term pollution peaks.

            <summary><h3>WHO guidelines</h3></summary>
            <p>
                The World Health Organization (WHO) provides international health-based air quality guidelines. 
                These values indicate levels above which air pollution may harm health. 
                They are not legally binding, but are widely used as a global health reference.
            </p>

        <details class="accordion">
            <summary><h3>EU limit values</h3></summary>
            <p>
                The European Union (EU) sets legally binding air quality limits. 
                These limits are used to assess compliance with environmental regulations 
                and are generally less strict than WHO guidelines.
            </p>

            <summary><h3>Measured data</h3></summary>
            <p>
                The values shown on this platform are measured NO₂ concentrations at specific locations. 
                They represent average concentrations over a defined period (for example, monthly averages).
            </p>
        </details>
        <br>
        <h3>Why does this matter for health?</h3>
        <p>
            Long-term exposure to elevated NO₂ levels can:
            • Irritate the lungs
            • Worsen asthma symptoms
            • Increase the risk of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases
            Especially in busy urban areas.
        </p>
        <h3>How are these measurements taken?</h3>
        <p>
            NO₂ levels are measured using passive diffusion tubes placed at multiple locations across the city, 
            including roadside, residential, and industrial areas.
