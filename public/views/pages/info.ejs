        <h3>What is NO₂?</h3>
        <p>
            Nitrogen dioxide (NO₂) is a harmful air pollutant mainly produced by road traffic, 
            generators, and industrial activities.
        </p>
        <h3>What do the colours mean?</h3>
        <p>
            The colours on the map indicate air quality levels. 
            They are based on measurements of nitrogen dioxide (NO₂), 
            a common air pollutant mainly caused by traffic and burning fuels.

            The colour scale ranges from Good (green) to Hazardous (dark purple). 
            Darker colours indicate higher pollution levels and a greater potential impact on health.

            <summary><h3>WHO guidelines</h3></summary>
            <p>
                The World Health Organization (WHO) provides international health-based air quality guidelines. 
                These values indicate levels above which air pollution may harm health. 
                They are not legally binding, but are widely used as a global health reference.
            </p>

            <summary><h3>EU limit values</h3></summary>
            <p>
                The European Union (EU) sets legally binding air quality limits. 
                These limits are used to assess compliance with environmental regulations 
                and are generally less strict than WHO guidelines.

            <summary><h3>Measured data</h3></summary>
            <p>
                The values shown on this platform are measured NO₂ concentrations at specific locations. 
                They represent average concentrations over a defined period (for example, monthly averages).
            </p>
        </details>
        <br>
        <h3>Why does this matter for health?</h3>
        <p>
            Long-term exposure to elevated NO₂ levels can:
        </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Irritate the lungs
                </li>
                <li>
                    Worsen asthma symptoms
                </li>
                <li>
                    Increase the risk of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases
                </li>
            </ul>
        <p>
            Especially in busy urban areas.
        </p>
        <h3>How are these measurements taken?</h3>
        <p>
            NO₂ levels are measured using passive diffusion tubes placed at multiple locations across the city, 
            including roadside, residential, and industrial areas.
